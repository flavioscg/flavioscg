## About Me

For a while, I was a friendly neighborhood computer technician. I've always been passionate about technology, hacking, and cybersecurity in general. I live for this field and am consistently driven by a strong determination to find solutions to any problems I encounter.

## üñ•Ô∏è **My Lab and tech stack**

My experiment lab, hidden in the basement like that of a Martian hacker in Area 51 üëΩüòù, is an agnostic environment where technological diversity reigns. I use a mix of desktop computers and laptops running Windows, GNU/Linux, macOS (both native and Hackintosh), and Raspberry Pi. I also have a server running Proxmox, with various virtual machines for my experiments and continuous learning. To top it off, I have routers with OpenWrt/DD-WRT.

When it comes to pentesting, the operating system doesn't matter: linux is linux. However, for convenience and the wide range of preinstalled tools, I often use ParrotOS, which I've seen evolve and have grown fond of over time ‚ù§Ô∏è.
